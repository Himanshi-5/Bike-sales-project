This project analyzes bike sales data to understand customer purchasing behavior.

🚴‍♀ **Bike Sales Dashboard – Excel Project**

I worked on this project to analyze bike sales data in Excel.
The project includes:
✔ Data cleaning
✔ Pivot tables and pivot charts
✔ Dashboard design

**I answered questions like:**

Which age group buys the most bikes?

Who buys more – married or single customers?

Which region has the most bike buyers?

Does income or commute distance affect bike buying?

📈 **Insights:**

Age group 35–44 purchased the most bikes

Married customers purchased slightly more than single

North America had the maximum bike buyers

Higher income and short-distance commuters purchased more bikes
